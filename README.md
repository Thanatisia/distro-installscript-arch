# distro-installscript-arch
Welcome to my ArchLinux distro install script. Designed to be &lt;b>Modular&lt;/b> and &lt;b>Portable&lt;/b>, you just need to open up the script, edit it with your basic information such as packages; distro user profile information (that you want to create) etc., and you can backup the file! Afterwhich, when you want to install the build, you just need to open it, edit the disk name (i.e. /dev/sd{a|b|c...} and run it. On running, with just several presses to confirm the details and it's done!
