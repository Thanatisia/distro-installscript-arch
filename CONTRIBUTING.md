## Repository and Commits

### Getting Started

contributions to the repository is categorised as any one of the following

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

If you are a first-timer, please take a look at 
	- [my Starter's Guide to Open Source Software](https://github.com/Thanatisia/SharedSpace/blob/main/Docs/Git/Starters-Guide.txt)

### Guidelines

Please make contributions to the repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own
- Please refer to [my Open Source Software guide](https://github.com/Thanatisia/SharedSpace/blob/main/Docs/Git/Open%20Source%20Contributions.txt) for more information and steps
	on the Contributions steps

### Issues

Issues are categorised as any one of the following

- Requesting a new feature
- Discuss Potential Changes before you create/PR is created

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

To summarise : follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)
